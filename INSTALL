Class::AutoClass
Class::AutoClass::Args

*** ALPHA SOFTWARE ***
These classes are still in their alpha state. Use is encouraged, and bug reporting is strongly encouraged :)
Although there are a hefty amount of unit and integration tests that stand behind these classes, there use in 
real-world scenarios has been limited, so don't do anything all mission-critical-like.

DESCRIPTION
Class::AutoClass => similar to Class::MakeMethods, provides support for:
- automatically generating mutator methods for simple values,
- allows for automatic attribute initialization and default value initilaization, 
- object initialization is handled correctly (in top-down order), even in the presence of multiple inheritance

Class::AutoClass::Args => argument list processing that normalizes argument lists by ignoring case and leading dashes ('-').  
In other words, the following keywords are all equivalent: 

  first_name, -first_name, -FIRST_NAME, --FIRST_NAME, First_Name, -First_Name
    

INSTALLATION

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

CAVEOTS
- AutoClass is not as powerful as Class::MakeMethods for method generation, nor is it meant to be. It serves as a 
  binder between AutoClass and AutoDB while providing for class instantiation and initialization.
- There are certainly documentation issues with auto-generated code. Although the code is cleaner
  and tighter by using autogenerated methods, they are difficult to document for all but the most 
  diligent among us.

TODO
- Autogeneration of list, hash methods is not yet supported
- Work on auto documenting routines
